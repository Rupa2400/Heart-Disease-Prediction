# Heart-Disease-Prediction

A heart disease prediction system is developed using one of the machine learning algorithms for predicting the risk level of heart disease. 
The heart disease prediction system predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease. 
The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.


This project is built in python programming and the gui is being added using tkinter.
The basic libraries used are numpy for arrays, numpy for basic machine learning analysis and matplot for graphical representations.
Sqlite is used for storing the database for new registering and login windows.
